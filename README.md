# Ghidra-Plugin-Autocollect


I think the easiest method to collaborate on this repo is

1. install amazon-corretto-11.0.12.7.1-windows-x64.msi
2. install Eclipse c++ 2021.09 with ghidradev 
3. install ghidra_10.0.4_PUBLIC_20210928
4. GhidraDev -> New Module into whatever workspace
5. git clone this repo into the workspace folder
6. in eclipse: GhidraDev -> Link Ghidra
7. Interactive debugging should now work.
